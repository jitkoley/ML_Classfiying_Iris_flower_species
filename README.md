# Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates a machine learning classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their features, using Python, Streamlit, and other common ML libraries. It follows the workflow described in a Medium blog post on Iris Flower Classification.

## Setup

### 1. Create a New Environment

To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```


### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment with this command:

#### On Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Train the Model

Follow the blog post for an introduction to Iris Flower Classification:

[**Iris Flower Classification on Medium**](https://medium.com/@markedwards.mba1/iris-flower-classification-using-ml-in-python-8d3c443bc319)

You can use the provided `Classification.ipynb` notebook to train, test, and save the model for feature prediction.

### 5. Predict with the Model

To make predictions with new data based on user input, use the `app.py` file. This file uses the trained model to predict Iris flower species based on the features provided by the user.

### 6. Run the Streamlit App

To start the Streamlit application and make predictions:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the application in your default browser, allowing users to input feature data and receive predictions on the Iris flower species.
